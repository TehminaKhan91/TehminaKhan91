👋 Hi, I'm @TehminaKhan91, a data enthusiast diving into the world of analytics and visualization.

👀 I'm interested in unraveling data mysteries, crafting insightful narratives, and exploring the intersection of technology and society.

🌱 I'm currently learning the ins and outs of Tableau, RStudio, SQL, and more, eager to elevate my data analysis game.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects that challenge the status quo, empower communities, or drive positive change through data-driven insights.
